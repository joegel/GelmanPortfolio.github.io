# I'm a copywriter, not a coder
This is a test to see if I _can_ build a site from scratch. _Should_ I have? Probably not ðŸ˜…

## Progress Log

### Goals for week of 9.12.21-9.17.21
- Figure out how to get the responsive navbar working
- Redo the Image Slider on project pages to actually work
  - Likely need to learn some JavaScript to do that (why not dive down that rabbit hole?)

### Goals for September
- Clean up the markup/styling so it's slimmer and more logical
- Add content for the rest of portfolio pages (at least prelim content)
- Look into building out Blog (maybe using Blogger? not sure, need to find references)
- Format resume (maybe it should be called CV? maybe don't even have it due to message it sends?)
- Figure out HTML forms to build Contact page
- Set up custom domain/email
- *FIND SOMEONE TO TEACH ME THIS* (Could be Eliezer, maybe Dotan knows someone)
